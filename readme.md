# Noise Orchestra

[Noise Orchestra](https://noiseorchestra.org/) are Manchester sound artists [Vicky Clarke](https://vickyclarke.org/about/) and [David Birchall](https://davidmbirchall.com/), we build Noise Machines that translate light into sound.  Working with light, DIY electronics, turntables and graphical scores, our practice operates at the intersection of art, experimental music and technology, manifesting in performance, DIY instrument making, sound walks, workshops and installations; all inspired by the photo-phonic principles of synthesizing sound from light.

This github page is dedicated to our work developing a platform and accessible devices that create a networked online multi-person space for playing music, rehearsing and broadcasting with good audio quality and stable low latency.

Made possible by the multi-machine audio system [JackTrip](https://github.com/jacktrip/jacktrip)
